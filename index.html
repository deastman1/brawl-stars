    <h2>Brawl Stars is a popular mobile game created and developed by Supercell.
        It is a top-bottom 2D shooter game that features many different characters <br>
        to choose from with unique ablities. The main focus of the game is to gain
        trophies through winning matches in various different gamemodes. Some characters <br>
        are made for some gamemodes so it will be harder playing them in any other.
