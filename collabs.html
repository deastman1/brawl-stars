      <h1>Collabs</h1>
      <h2>Brawl Stars has featured many different collabs through the years. The collabs
        provide new exclusive skins for brawlers and new game modes to play. Some <br>
         events/collabs even had limited time shops with a new currency used to purchase the
          exclusive things, or just progressive items like coins or new brawlers. The collabs <br>
          Brawl Stars has participated in include Spongebob, Godzilla, Toy Story, and many
          more. All these collabs introduce new skins and ways of progression that continue <br>
          to make the game much more engaging.
