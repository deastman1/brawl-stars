      <h1>Brawlers</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/" target="_blank">Brawl Stars</a> is a game of combat and 2D shooting. Brawlers
        are the characters you play as. Every brawler has different <br>
        abilites and a unique play style. The brawlers are unique
        through attacking, their supers, appearances, and cosmetics.

      <h4>Cosmetics</h4>
      <h2>Add-ons for brawlers can alter the play style of them.
        It can make dealing with enemies more efficient or confusing. <br>
        The first ones are Gadgets. Gadgets are three time uses that
        are unique for each brawler. These can heal, be a new attack, <br>
        or a state the brawler can enter for a short amount of time.
        The second ones are Gears. These are small consistent changes <br>
        that strength the brawler. For example, resistence, damage buff,
        or a fourth gadget use. They are given to every brawler and are<br>
        not unique. The third ones are starpowers, similar to gears but
        offer changes that are unique to the brawler. This can be adding <br>
        flame effects, altering projectile movements, or a state that
        they can enter. Lastly are hypercharges (explained in History page)<br>
