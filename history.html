      <h1>History</h1>
      <h2>The history of Brawl Stars include major game changes
        that have affected the game greatly through gameplay aspects. <br>
        Some game changes include the removal of Megaboxes, the adding of
        Powers 10 and 11, and the introduction of hypercharges.
    </h2>
    <h4>Megaboxes</h4>
    <h2>Megaboxes used to be a major role within Brawl Star's rewarded
        system. Currently, the game includes Starr Drops, a pinata <br>
        that rewards the player with a currency such as coins, powerpoints, and gems,
        all with different uses. Before, Brawl Stars used <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/" target="_blank">Megaboxes</a> <br>
        within their reward system, where the player would be able to
        recieve multiple rewards but in smaller amounts. This would also <br>
        mean there was higher rates of recieving a rarer reward such as
        skins, pins, or new brawlers.
    </h2>
    <h4>Power 9</h4>
    <h2>Brawlers are the character within the game that you play as. Upgrading
        them with coins and powerpoints allows them to be stronger in health <br>
        and damage. In the earlier stages of Brawl Stars, the max level would be
        Power 9. Now, the max level has been increased to Power 11, allowing <br>
        the brawler to be much stronger. This also meant more currency is being
        put into the brawler, encouraging the player to play for rewards more often.
    </h2>
    <h4>Hypercharges</h4>
    <h2>Brawl Star's game mechanics have not changed much throuhout the updates,
        but the addition of Hypercharges impacted the game and how you play heavily. <br>
        Brawlers have two attacking buttons. The main one is the attack button,
        shooting or punching. The second is the super, a bigger attack charged <br>
        by attacking. These allow brawlers to be much more unique. Hypercharges
        sprout from supers, they take longer to charge but within the state <br>
        of a hypercharge you recieve buffs and your super has added components.
        The feature is awfully new, as only a handful of brawlers have them. <br>
        They are expensive to purchase with coins but change the way you play
        the brawler heavily.
