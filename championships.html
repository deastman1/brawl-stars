      <h2><a href="https://event.supercell.com/brawlstars/en" target="_blank">WorldFinals</a> are an important part of Brawl Stars community.
        Players can participate by watching live streams through youtube or the real game. <br>
        To begin participating, the player would have to compete in annual competitions and
        challenges with a minimal amount of loses to be able to move forward in the process. <br>
        Championships are competed within teams as most gamemodes are 3v3s. Cash prizes
        can be won as well. ESports is a company that streams these games and events <br>
        so players can watch. They also work with Supercell to make the WorldFinals and
        other championships such as the MonthlyFinals. <br> <br>
        The MonthlyFinals take place every month as a smaller WorldFinals. The reward of cash
        is smaller but the event is much more often. Professional teams use these events as <br>
        practice for professional matches, to gain fame, or just the money. These can be tickets 
        for a place somewhere bigger like the World Finals if one wins.
